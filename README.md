# Cipher

### Summary
This is a simple Python application that will unscramble a cipher text.

### Requirements
You will need Python 3 on your system which can be found [here](python.org).  Make sure you are using Python 3 instead of 2 since the syntax differs enough to make a difference here.

### To run
Clone this repo using the GitHub GUI or you can do a `git clone` locally on your system if you are comfortable with terminal commands.

After you clone this, navigate to the directory you have and use the python command of `python unscramble_text.py`.
